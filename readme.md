Could improve by:

## High priority:
- [ ] Document chunking (split documents in semantic chunks)
- [ ] Add source attributions in chat responses
- [ ] Use a structured response format for the chatbot

## Medium priority:
- [ ] Hybrid search (combine vector search and keyword search)
- [ ] Better tracking for what URLs we scraped and not scraped
- [ ] When scraping, use AI to detect if the document has medical relevance to TRT, steroids, testosterone, etc.

## Low priority:
- [ ] Metadata enrichment (more metadata like URL, section headers, doc type, topic classification)

## Ongoing:
- [ ] Add more studies
