Could improve by:

## TODOs

- [ ] Add a tracking system for what documents have been scraped; we don't want to scrape the same document multiple times; this is especially useful as we add more sources
- [ ] Add a more automated scraping system which crawls given websites and adds new sources;

## Maybe

- [ ] Improve source attribution in chat responses (e.g. include paper title, publication year, journal, section where information was found); maybe not worthwhile and we could just point the user to the document
- [ ] Implement semantic chunking based on section headers, smart overlap that preserves complete sentences and dynamic chunk sized based on content type
